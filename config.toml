- 👋 Welcome. I'm documenting key learnings and experiments from my ongoing work in GPU computing.
- 🧩 This site collects focused examples of CUDA implementations — from memory management and performance profiling to real-time rendering techniques and system-level optimization.    
- 🛠️ Each post is backed by runnable code, shared openly on [GitHub](https://github.com/yaikeda/cuda-examples), and written to be useful for both learning and collaboration.
